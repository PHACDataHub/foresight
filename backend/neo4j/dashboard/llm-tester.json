        "neodash_context": "The Best Olive Oil You Can Buy at the Store\n\nBy Michael Sullivan\n\nUpdated August 31, 2023\n\nDrizzling good olive oil over perfectly ripe tomatoes and mopping it up with a crusty knob of bread is one of the greatest pleasures of summertime. But that moment will quickly sour if the oil you’re using is rancid.\nOut of the dizzying variety of olive oil brands at your local supermarket, we wanted to find the ones that are actually worth buying. Many bottles have been sitting on store shelves far longer than they should, with oil that’s past its prime or cut with inferior oils.\n\nAfter researching over 40 bottles of oil and speaking with a trained olive oil taster to help define our criteria, we tested 15 olive oils available at national grocery store chains across the country. We focused on those with printed harvest dates, which are the most reliable way to make sure your oil is fresh.\n\nOur goal was to find good all-purpose extra-virgin olive oils that could be used for cooking (which EVOO is great for, by the way) but also for salad dressings and bread dipping. Here are the ones that stood out in our tests.",

        "neodash_unlabeled_text": "According to the CDFA, “cold pressed” means the olives were pressed or crushed using a mechanical, hydraulic, or centrifugal press at a temperature that doesn’t lead to significant thermal alterations of the oil. Olive oil expert Kathryn Tomajan said this term is a holdover from before most oils were extracted using stainless steel crushers and centrifuges. Many people still think they need to look for this terminology on the label, so producers continue to include it.\n\nYou may also see the terms “first pressed” or “first extracted,” which Tomajan said implies that the oil is extracted from fresh olives only—never a second extraction from olive pomace. But this terminology is also redundant, as any extra virgin olive oil is, by definition, always both cold- and first-extracted.",

Hong Kong public hospitals have seen an increase of eight suspected cases in a single day, including a two-year-old boy.\nThe cause of the pneumonia is not yet known, but some experts suspect it may be related to  the new coronavirus.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee has announced that seven of the reported cases are serious. The number of reported cases increased by 60% in just four days. Hong Kong scholars believe there may be a connection to the new coronavirus based on mainland sources, but human transmission is also a possibility.\nTwo more cases of fever have been reported in Hong Kong after returning from Wuhan, and three of those cases were confirmed as influenza A(H3). The Centre for Health Protection has expanded monitoring and requires patients who have traveled to Wuhan to report.",

Harvey Elliott’s deflected effort then put Jurgen Klopp’s side ahead before Marcus Rashford levelled the game once again with a cool finish.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho then put Amad through on goal, and his effort squeezed past goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher into the net to give United a crucial victory.\n\nTen Hag was delighted with his side’s performance, saying “we have a team that is for the future”.\n\nHe said to ITV Sport: “To go to the final we have to win against Coventry, we will have to play at our best. We saw that Coventry have great spirit, a great mentality. We will prepare our best to play in the final.\n\n“The first 30 minutes was the best of our whole season, we were acting as a team but then we got gaps between the lines and you can’t allow this against one of the best teams in Europe. They outplayed us.\n\n“Then we made changes, we took risks and the players were wonderful. The attitude was great, a strong belief to win this game.\n\n“Rashford is resilient, he keeps going, normally he finishes those moments but he kept going for another chance. That inspired the other players.\n\n“We have a team that is for the future. Coming up are players who are developing very well like (Amad) Diallo, (Alejandro) Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo.”\n\nTen Hag also expressed that he is hopeful the result can be a turning point for his side.\n\nHe added in his post-match press conference: “Could be but we miss so many opportunities, Arsenal in the fourth game the 87th minute we should have had a pen on Rasmus Hojlund, then we scored with Garnacho, (it was) disallowed, and then we concede a goal that should be disallowed so such moments can help you.\n\n“We never had it but this could be that moment, the team, the belief and energy to do amazing things. When you beat Liverpool, you can beat any opponent.”\n\nUnited will face Championship side Coventry City in the semi-final at Wembley Stadium.",
